p1 doesn't output the correct output but the logic is good

p4 you need to check more colour combinations:

if user_colour == 'red' or user_colour == 'Red' or user_colour == 'RED'

p5 Your if statement on line 3 is properly constructed and you need to use a nested if in this problem

p6 after line 1 you could write userage = int(userage) then you would not need to keep writing int(userage). Also, the else at the end doesn't need an if. Else will always run if nothing before it is true.

p7 same idea with int() and also else doesn't need an if

p8 else doesn't need an if

p9 On line 2 you converted unit to an int(). You don't need to convert it to a float for the rest of the program. The calculation is not correct for the different unit values.
